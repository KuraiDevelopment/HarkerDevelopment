# DayZ Dev Website – Vercel Static Deploy

This package contains a single-page static site ready for Vercel.

## Files
- `index.html` – your site entry file (copied from your original `dayz_dev_website.html`).

## Deploy on Vercel
1. Create a new Project on Vercel.
2. Select “Import…” and upload this zip, or push these files to a new Git repo and import it.
3. No `vercel.json` is required. Vercel will serve `index.html` automatically.
4. Visit your deployment URL.

## Optional
- If you want to keep a non-index filename, add a `vercel.json` with a rewrite to that file.
